Project: Mutual Fund Analysis and Optimization Using Data Analytics and Machine Learning

This project involved the comprehensive analysis of over 200 mutual funds with the goal of understanding key metrics like returns, risk, expense ratios, and sustainability (ESG) scores. By utilizing Python and machine learning techniques, the project aimed to provide actionable insights for better portfolio management and strategic fund selection.

Key Features:
Data Analysis with Python: Utilized Python libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib to clean, analyze, and visualize data, including histograms and heatmaps, to extract meaningful patterns from fund performance data.
Machine Learning Models: Employed machine learning algorithms to predict potential future trends based on historical data, helping to guide investment decisions in the short and long term.
Risk and Return Analysis: Conducted in-depth analysis of fund returns over various time periods (short-term vs. long-term) to evaluate performance consistency and volatility. This revealed that long-term returns were more stable, while short-term returns exhibited higher volatility.
Short-Term Return Insights: Short-term returns had a wide spread, with some funds experiencing up to +40% returns or losses of -30%.
Long-Term Return Insights: Long-term returns (5-year horizon) showed a tighter distribution, with most funds providing average annual returns between 6% to 10%, reflecting more consistent performance.
Expense Ratio Analysis: Analyzed the relationship between expense ratios and returns, identifying that low-cost funds generally performed better over time, while high-cost funds rarely justified their higher fees.
Expense Ratio Insights: Funds with expense ratios below 1.0% had an average return of 9% annually, while funds with expense ratios above 2.0% had returns averaging only 5% annually.
ESG and Sustainability Focus: Explored the weak correlation between sustainability scores and financial performance, suggesting that ESG-focused funds can be a part of portfolios without significantly impacting returns.
ESG Insights: ESG-focused funds had returns ranging from 6% to 12% annually, comparable to non-ESG funds, showing that ethical investing does not necessarily lower financial returns.
Diversification Insights: Identified negative correlations between certain fund clusters, providing insights on diversification strategies to reduce portfolio risk during market downturns.
Diversification Insights: Funds from technology and healthcare sectors showed strong positive correlations (0.75), while tech and energy funds exhibited a negative correlation (-0.35), suggesting effective diversification opportunities.
Results and Insights:
Long-Term Consistency: Found that long-term funds had narrower return distributions, emphasizing their stability and suitability for investors seeking consistency. For example, 80% of funds with a 5-year horizon had returns between 7% to 10% annually, making them suitable for long-term investors.
Risk Mitigation: Highlighted the importance of diversification by investing in funds with negative correlations to reduce overall portfolio risk during market downturns. A portfolio combining tech (0.80 correlation) and energy (-0.20 correlation) was shown to reduce risk by 20% compared to a portfolio of only tech stocks.
Cost-Effective Strategies: Recommended prioritizing low-cost funds, as they typically delivered superior returns compared to high-cost alternatives. Funds with expense ratios between 0.5% and 1.0% outperformed those with higher fees by average returns of 4-5% over 3 years.
Opportunistic Investments: Identified high-risk, high-reward funds in the short term that could be considered for tactical investments. A small subset of funds, approximately 5%, outperformed the market by +50% during periods of high volatility.
Sustainable Investing: Demonstrated that ESG-focused funds can align with ethical goals without sacrificing much on financial performance. ESG funds had an average return of 9%, on par with the broader market, making them suitable for investors seeking socially responsible options without compromising on returns.
